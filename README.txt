# BlueJ-DreamHouseDrawing

This is the first BlueJ lab. 

It has TWO BlueJ Projects in it. Both are germain to the Chapter 1 in the doc folder.
You will follow the chapter first in `Shapes` folder and then in `Picture` folder.

__BUT__ you need to open these projects, NOT the ones that came with your BlueJ download. Use
`Project -> Open Project...` to find your `dev/FirstLab-Shapes` folder. Open `Shapes` there. (and the same is
for `Picture`).

Running your code via **TESTS** *is crucial*. Note carefully the instructions on how to run your code in the PictureTest class. This is the way professionals do it.

Be sure to 

* **Read this file carefully.**
* For the first section of the lab, open the BlueJ project file Shapes/project.bluej from Finder
* the README.TXT file in Shapes/README.TXT
* notice how the README follows what was lectured
* For the second section, use Picture/package.bluej
* the README.TXT file in Picture/README.TXT
* Use the *DrawTest() method in the PictureTest class* to run the various tries at your house drawing
* Edit the draw() method in Picture class to get the drawing instructions right

Object of lab is to follow the chapter reading the Chapter 1 pdf in the doc folder. (and Draw a House!)

Can you draw a house with a tree along side? (think `trunk` and `circle` or a tall, skinny `triangle`.)

When finished, post a screen shot of your house to the slack CHATTER channel.
